## Backstory

Through the miracle of innovative **EmotoSphere** <sup>TM</sup> technology, we promise a return to baseline temperament for all the current models of modern replicants. _Making the world a better place through synergistic emotional architecture._ Visit a **_Cyborg Garden_** near you today!
